# documentation

This is the repository for Sad Runner's organizational documentation site (http://docs.sadrunner.com). Our goal with documentation is to provide a clear but exhaustive guide for growing and maintaining the Sad Runner brand, communities, properties and mission. We believe documentation is never done and our intention is to continue to build off of this guide as Sad Runner continues to evolve.

## Contributing

If you are a member of the Sad Runner Community, there are two ways to contribute to this project. First, you can suggest amendments, changes or additions to our documentation by creating an issue for this repository. Second, if you want to contribute in a technical way, then please feel free to get your Fork on and start coding. We'd love to see what you come up with.

## Documentation Template

This site relies on The Docs premium html template based on Bootstrap. We purchased the theme for specific use on this project so please do not copy it for any use other than for working on Sad Runner. The Docs is a great theme and you should definitely give it a try if you like how this site looks. Just please purchase it and support the developer. Thank you.
